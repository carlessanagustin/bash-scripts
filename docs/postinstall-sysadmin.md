## Post-installation scripts for sysadmins

> Note: This section needs a code review, more tests and eventually some refactoring in order to make my opinionated settings acceptable for a wider audience.

This is an opinionated way I configure my system:

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frgomes/bash-scripts/master/postinstall-sysadmin.sh -O - | bash
```
